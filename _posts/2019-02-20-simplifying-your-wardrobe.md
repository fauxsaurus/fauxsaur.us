Here are a few tips and tricks that have helped me slim down my wardrobe.

## Only Keep Your Favorites
First, use the [KonMari](https://konmari.com/pages/who-we-are){:target="_blank"} method. Get all of your clothes together and eliminate the ones you don't like. Yes, this can be difficult, especially if the stuff on the chopping block was a gift, but some decisions are no brainers.

  * Is it damaged? (holes or stains)
  * Is it functional? (the pockets are too short, causing you to dump your phone out every time you sit down)
  * [Can you remember the last time you wore it](https://lifehacker.com/weed-out-the-clothes-you-dont-wear-with-a-simple-hanger-5502694){:target="_blank"}? If you can't and its not formal wear, you might not need it.

You'll probably know instinctively if you like a piece of clothing or not, but start out easy by dividing things into four categories: love, meh, hate, and hated gifts & then go from there. Ideally you'll only end up with stuff you love, but if not every bit helps.

And, if you wish to prevent acquiring unsolicited clothes in the future, just tell your friends and family that you're downsizing or going minimalist, so you've got clothing covered.

## Keep a List of Everything You Own
And as extra motivation to par things down, tell yourself that you will take inventory of every piece of clothing that you own at the end, and that you will keep the list updated (this works great for everything else you own as well). Keeping/maintaining a record of everything you own puts an added burden on acquiring new stuff, and the perceived inconvenience of adding to the list may make you think twice before making an impulse purchase.

Also, if you number the list, you might find yourself playing inventory golf to minimize/optimize your belongings. I personally have a Google Doc with all of my possessions and links/notes to buy them again should they need to be replaced. This is especially great if you [lose your possessions in a fire](https://twocents.lifehacker.com/how-to-document-your-personal-possessions-in-case-of-em-1830995883){:target="_blank"} as insurance agents will be able to quickly appraise the value of your stuff and you'll be able to restock quicker.

I started tracking my belongings when I graduated High School. And when I went through my closet, I found that over the course of four years, I'd accumulated a ton of T-Shirts from all the various: clubs, fundraisers, events, and gifts I'd received. In the end, I'd amassed about 120 T-Shirts, which was clearly far too many, especially considering the fact that I didn't wear that many of them #firstWorldProblems.

## How much is too much?
Of course it depends on how many clothes you should shoot for, but I personally recommend limiting your wardrobe to having roughly enough outfits for one week. Note: I'm strictly talking about casual, everyday clothing and excluding work uniforms, coats/jackets, and formal wear. And, if you want to keep a bunch of shirts, just limit your pants, under garmets, and socks to get down to a week's worth of clothes. I personally have 26 shirts at this time and I've still reaped many of these benefits.

One week's worth of clothes may seem extreme, but it prevents dirty laundry and clean clothes from piling up, which is especially important for large families full of irresponsible children/parents. If everyone can outlast the apocalypse, or at least be able to get by for a month, it will pile up and someone will eventually have to deal with comically large mountains clothing for absolutely no reason.

And doing laundry once a week is much better than having to deal with a pile of fermented clothes every month. For laundry hampers, I personally recommend the [AmazonBasics Foldable Hamper](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IG6C0D4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=minifyre-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01IG6C0D4&linkId=9181b26f475e7dd0c87aa3525438ca1c){:target="_blank"} as it: folds up, is easy to clean, and holds about as much clothing as the average washer/dryer.

They say that prevention is the best cure and I'll add that if you don't let it become a problem, you don't have to find a solution. Also, making it impossible for a system to break down is better than putting a bunch of safeguards and contingencies in place to prevent/delay the inevitable. Low maintenance is key.

## Great goal, how do I get there?
### Short Black Socks
First, there are a few ways you can cut back on stuff. Personally, I eliminated all socks, except for short black ones. This idea may seem appalling to crazy sock lovers, but to me, this felt so liberating. These socks go with both formal and casual clothes (thanks Nike/Adidas black sock promotional campaign) and I'm able to get ready for work and grab a pair in the dark without worrying about if they went with what I was wearing or not before I ran out the door.

Also, if every single sock is the same type, there's no more sorting them out and matching them up, which adds up to a huge time saver. For those wondering about long socks, I've never seen the need for them (especially because they can be [painful](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/66f0p2/eli5why_do_your_leg_hairs_hurt_after_wearing/){:target="_blank"}). And if you're worried about what people will say if they catch you wearing "short socks with jeans", just make sure you're wearing properly fitting pants and no one will ever know. Then they won't be able to judge you like it's the 1800s.
### Consolidate Favorites

{% include img.html url="/img/combine-clothes.jpg" description="Graphics Tees + Sleevless Shirts = Graphic Sleevless Shirts" %}

Last year, I noticed that I was wearing a bunch of plain sleeveless shirts, despite having a ton of graphic tees that I also enjoyed wearing. This year, I've decided to combine them into custom, sleeveless shirts with my favorite designs. This might seem drastic, but I've essentially combined all aspects of my favorite shirts (sleeveless with minimalist graphics) into one, further reducing my wardrobe into something that I will completely enjoy wearing every day.

For those wanting a lame excuse to do this, [studies have shown that clothing affects our emotions and perceptions](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dress-for-success-how-clothes-influence-our-performance/), so you might not be getting the best results if you don't completely like what you're wearing.
## Saving Space
### Folding & Rolling
Now that you've thinned the herd, you there are a couple of ways you can further reduce the space that everything takes up. For the unaware, there are many ways to fold your socks, shirts, and shorts on a continuum of saving time/space. Socks: inverted bundle, [army ranger roll](https://lifehacker.com/save-packing-space-by-folding-your-socks-like-an-army-r-1602028370){:target="_blank"}, ["origami" square fold](https://lifehacker.com/fold-socks-instead-of-rolling-them-for-better-organizat-1774473784){:target="_blank"}.

For shirts, I use the so called ["Japanese method"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AWQ5aBjgE){:target="_blank"} to quickly fold up shirts before rolling them to save space and [preventing wrinkles](https://lifehacker.com/rolling-clothes-prevents-wrinkles-and-saves-packing-spa-5533463){:target="_blank"} (it's also clear which shirts are which when you're done rolling them).

This technique is also great for [travel](https://lifehacker.com/pack-your-suitcase-as-efficiently-as-a-flight-attendant-5788501){:target="_blank"}. I've never needed anything more than a tiny duffel bag for weekend trips, or a small suitcase for longer excursions. And these techniques might even save enough space for you to get rid of your dresser at home.
### Dresser Alternatives: "Clothing Cubes"

{% include img.html url="/img/clothing-cubes.jpg" description="Clothing cubes about halfway through the week." pin="784963410031324864" %}

If you feel that you no longer need a full dresser to store everything and would like to save space here too, there are a couple of things you can do. I used to have an [over the door hanging shoe organizer](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CG2R9ST/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=minifyre-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07CG2R9ST&linkId=dd36c783d2e23c77d87c8540b54efe84&pldnSite=1){:target="_blank"} with clear pockets to stuff my rolled up T-Shirts in, but I've since moved everything into some [wireframe storage cubes](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ELAS9G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007ELAS9G&linkCode=as2&tag=minifyre-20&linkId=a5c5ebc116bb56bec4f3fe4e89473463){:target="_blank"} that slide under my bed. For the more adventurous, these could also be used as a nightstand with some sort of fabric cover over it.

The edges are easy enough to snap into place and with a few zip ties, you can add dividers that neatly partition everything out. Pro tip: make sure the "sharp" corners of the zip ties are not exposed on the bottom so that your clothing doesn't get snagged when you go to pull it out. Zip tying the top and back of the dividers will do just fine.

Overall, this system has worked out pretty well for me and is great for a many reasons. First, these "clothing cubes" don't take up much space. And you don't have to get out of bed to pick your clothes out for the day, which can also save a bit of time if you're running late. You can put the T-Shirts on the side to see which ones are which. And if you only wear clothing at the bottom of each stack, you'll naturally rotate through everything.

{% include img.html url="/img/seasonal-clothes-in-back.jpg" description="Seasonal clothing in back." orientation="portrait" %}

Out of season clothing can be placed upright in the back since rolled up stuff won't be long enough to reach back there. Also, you'll porbably have more empty space in the summer since shorts and sleeveless shirts take up less space than long sleeve shirts and jeans. Despite living in an area with a variable climate, I personally wear short/sleeveless shirts year round since I have long arms that long sleeve shirts never seem to fit quite right. As for how I survive winter, jackets and coats work just fine.

And I haven't quite made it to this stage, but if you can fit everything into one cube, you can take it with you and directly load your clothes into it from the dryer. And for the unaware, air drying your clothes in the winter works great for replenishing the humidity indoors (just be warned that they'll feel a bit rougher). I personally ended up with [this folding dryer rack](https://smile.amazon.com/Honey-Can-Do-Large-Folding-Drying-Silver/dp/B001F51A7Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=drying+rack&qid=1551301788&s=gateway&sr=8-8&linkCode=ll1&tag=minifyre-20&linkId=8cfdfa9da342bd9542a7f2ec8f48a1bc&language=en_US){:target="_blank"}, but I'm sure others work just as well.


## Rinse & Repeat
Things/tastes change. Maybe go through this whole process once a year for Spring Cleaning. And if you've gone minimalist, this won't take too long!
