**Satirical Warning:** The following contains ~~spoilers and~~ opinions.

RWBY is not full of fetishized fanservice (though the camera could have aimed a little higher in the final trailer's opening). Instead, it features a colorful cast of characters in a unique world that seamlessly blends elements of sci-fi & fantasy with modernity. Also, the fight scenes, weapons, and music are amazing.

## Music
The music in each trailer sounds great on its own, but when paired with the visuals, each song helps inform the rhythm & phases of each fight. Additionally, each track sets a unique tone that perfectly reflects every character's personality. I particularly enjoyed, the vocals and accompanying instruments in the first two compositions. And as someone who doesn't usually enjoy Spanish guitars, that should speak volumes. I also thought it was clever how the second trailer linked the music in with the on screen recital.

And while I wasn't as big of a fan of the third song, the final trailer did an exceptional job of remixing the previous three together in a manner befitting a dance club. All in all, each song was custom tailored to each trailer and well integrated with the imagery on screen.
## Weapons
The weapons also had a surprising amount of depth. And their many forms and modes gave each character a unique fighting style complete with tons of mobility, melee, and ranged options.

### Red Trailer
The giant gun scythe in the first trailer folds: up for travel, into a sniper rifle, and, well, a scythe. Rather than these simply being different standalone forms, the blade and the gun aspects have quite a bit of synergy with one another. For instance, the blade acts as a stand while firing and the recoil has enough force to speed up a swing and decapitate opponents. It even enhances mobility by speeding up dashes via recoil and reducing momentum with the blade after getting knocked back. Plus, it can take different types of ammo.

### White Trailer
The rapier in the second trailer is mechanically less complex and gunlike than its counterparts, but the dial on its hilt is reminiscent of a revolver cylinder that toggles between different elemental effects on the fly. And the way some of the ranged attacks are evoked seems a bit like waving a wand or a composer's baton, which is fitting given the setting. And the platforms Weiss jumps and slides around on give her a nice boost in mobility and also tie in with the snow and ice theme.
### Black Trailer
The weapons and setting in the third trailer are a departure from the more european-centric aesthetics established in the previous trailers. As such, the characters move & fight like a ninja and samurai respectively (they also have a knack for running and blocking bullets). The masked man's scabbard launches his sword for quicker draw strikes, or even a blunt hilt strike, and then serves as a standalone gun when the blade is unsheathed.

But Blake's weapon is even more complex in that it acts as: a cleaver while sheathed (which is very safe), a katana, a gun, and a ballistic chain scythe, or a kusarigama gun if you prefer. And the ribbon just so happens to be wrapped around the trigger, causing it to fire when swung. In turn, the blast recoil further accelerates it like its giant counterpart in the first trailer. The skill required to wield this weapon is insane, making it both totally cool and completely dangerous/impractical. Also, her weapon could probably be used as a grappling hook to quickly close distances between opponents.
### Yellow Trailer

Finally, the fourth trailer shows Yang's bracelets unfolding to form shotgun gauntlets that amplify the force of her punches & throws in addition to improving her dash & jump. Her opponent, Junior, has a rocket launcher that turns into a bat, though it's not quite as durable. And the twins' claws & spiked heels are more of a novelty. All in all, these weapons are pretty good and some bits even look like they came straight out of a 2D fighter.
## Influences
### Video Games and Anime
Speaking of which, the bright colors and art style both take quite a bit of influence from video games and anime (though most of the characters thankfully have a bit more clothing than stereotypical female protagonists). But classifying RWBY as being/not being anime is a discussion for another day. For now, all I'll say is that the aesthetic is a unique blend of cel shading and 3D rendering that I've yet to see replicated elsewhere. Also, the fact that the assets are all 3D models means that this property is primed for a faithful video game adaptation. And save for the twins, every character has a unique appearance and distinct fighting style complete with plenty of mobility and combat options.
### Color
Plus, everyone has a strong, unique color scheme that prevents them from getting lost amidst the chaos on screen. Every trailer features a fair amount of red, black and white, but the White trailer drops most of the red which the Black trailer ironically picks up.

{% include img.html url="/img/rwby-black-trailer.jpg" description="RWBY's Black Trailer utilizes a large amount of red." %}

Though to be fair, this use of red does help accentuate the characters' black and white clothing a bit better. The first two trailers also have a fair bit of snow, which the second trailer puts on full display with the palette, iconography, flooring, and skating parts. And despite its namesake, the Yellow trailer doesn't feature much yellow, save for the motorcycle and Yang herself, which only further serves to shine the spotlight on her.
### Fairy Tales and Other References
I also think it's neat how the character designs took influence from fairy tales and put a unique twist on them. There's a certain amount of thematic novelty in a red riding hood-esque character fending off wolves. "Weiss Schnee" translated from German to English literally means "White Snow" and the "Mirror Mirror" lyrics are a further nod to this. And though it's a bit of a stretch, some say that her pendent looks a bit like an apple. Blake's connection is best saved for a another time, but Yang took inspiration from Goldilocks. Her opponent Junior and the bear mask DJ further allude to this theme, as well as serving as a nod to Deadmau5. And "Blondie" could be a reference to the voice actress' (Barbara Dunkelman) prior work, in addition to Yang's appearance. Finally, the grave's text in the Red Trailer is a deeper reference to Thomas Moore's poem, "The Last Rose Of Summer".
## Continuity
### Voice Acting
Aside from external references, the trailers also link together well and go through a nice form of progression as production on the show ramped up. The first trailer has no dialogue, the second has an overhead introduction & singing, while the third goes on to have a bit of dialogue, and the fourth one has a ton of speaking.

Unfortunately, some of the voice acting falls a bit flat, but I suppose that's to be expected when first settling into a role that might not fully be fleshed out at the time of recording. I often find the performances in pilots, which I guess we can consider these to be, a bit jarring compared to those in later episodes when the actor has gotten in the groove of things.
### Moon
Also, the moon in the first trailer is whole, a bit cracked in the second one, and quite destroyed in the third and fourth ones. Though the second sphere in the fourth trailer calls this into question. And without more context, it's impossible to know if it is the sun, another moon, or simply a mistake.

{% include img.html url="/img/rwby-moonslice.jpg" description="RWBY's cracked moon in the Black Trailer." %}

### Eras
Aside from the moon, there's also a nice bit of evolution of elements from different eras between the trailers as well. The first starts off in the wilderness with a scythe, the second one picks up in a giant hall with a medieval suit of armor, the third introduces trains & mechs, while the fourth presents a modern nightclub & motorcycle.
## Conclusion
To say these trailers were unconventional would be an understatement. They all contain unique footage and give few hints as to what's to come. Given their standalone nature, it may be more accurate to call them shorts, which I think is better in the long run as they don't lose their relevance after the first season. And while they didn't reveal much about the characters,

  * Ruby is Yang's sister (despite looking nothing like her).
  * Weiss is probably from a higher class.
  * Blake is a criminal who wants no part in a plan that would endanger others.
  * Yang is looking for someone, possibly Blake given the image ([actual image](https://www.deviantart.com/montyoum/art/Transient-Princess-136525544){:target="_blank"}) and is a bit more "mature".

these trailers showcased the unique world and the talents of the cast & crew which made me interested to see what's next on a technical level. And the fact that such disparate elements like guns and blades complimented each other so well, shows that a lot of care and planning went into this, and that everything was well thought out. That attention to detail hints at a greater vision behind everything, which makes me eager to see where things go from here.

In short, these trailers serve as a solid based to build off of and lived up to my hopes for any collection of related works. Individually, they are unique, yet collectively uniform. They function as standalone works, but together they form a whole greater than the sum of their parts.
## Miscellaneous Musings
### Promotion
I feel Rooster Teeth did a good job promoting RWBY by premiering the trailers in different/thematic places: [Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYW2GmHB5xs){:target="_blank"} (*Red* vs Blue Finale), [White](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt9vl8iAN5Q){:target="_blank"} (Ain't it *Cool* News), [Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImKCt7BD4U4){:target="_blank"} (Crunchyroll compliments the part of the world showcased), and [Yellow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCw_aAS7vWI){:target="_blank"} (MTV Geek  compliments the more "mature" tone).
### Art Nitpick
The 2D portrait faces in the end cards look a bit off and don't seem quite on model. But it's possible that's just the artist's style, or maybe the references were updated between the time they were drawn & when the trailers were released. Overall, I think they were well done.
### Similarities to Metal Gear Rising's Jetstream Sam

{% include img.html url="/img/rwby-adam-tarus-vs-mgr-jetsream-sam.jpg" description="The Black Trailer's masked man and Metal Gear Rising's Jetstream Sam." %}

The masked man in the third trailer bears a striking resemblance to Metal Gear Rising's Jetstream Sam: samurai-like draw strikes, red sword that was previously gray in earlier versions of the trailer (can't find this image/clip), and trigger-based blade launching scabbard (though the masked man's sheath goes even farther by serving as a standalone gun which is pretty neat).

To be clear these [similarities](https://i.imgur.com/RfCRYvt.png){:target="_blank"} don't bother me, as we can never have too many sword fights on a train, but it's something I found interesting and thought was worth pointing out. But, for those who take issue with this, the creator, Monty Oum, stated that he was inspired by a different source all together and the timeline backs his claim.
