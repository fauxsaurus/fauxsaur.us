		<p>Thirteen-year-old Olivia L. Wade has been plagued by a ghost that no one else quite seems to believe exists. But when things come to a head, she'll get swept up in a police investigation looking into a recently apprehended vigilante from Detroit and cross paths with others who've come face-to-face with the ghost along the way. Will she and her ragtag team come together and rise to the occasion to defeat her tormentor before time runs out? Only one way to find out!</p>
