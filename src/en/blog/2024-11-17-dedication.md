It has always been a minor pet peeve of mine when authors dedicate all their books to their spouses. To be clear, I don't begrudge anyone for doing soâ€”it's certainly within their right, and rationally, I don't see anything wrong with it. But deep down, part of that practice has always bugged me because there are so many people in my life I'd like to dedicate things to (or maybe this "admirable desire" merely stems from an idiosyncrasy to never do the same thing twice).

Irrespective of underlying motivations, this book isn't dedicated to any one individual in particular, as I felt that there were more relevant writings I'd done (or would like to do) that would be more fitting for the usual suspects. As such, I hadn't given much thought to who to dedicate this work to until I was determining what pages were absolutely necessary to slot in before the story.

So, while putting the ebook together, I decided to go back to some of the underlying motivations behind this project, namely my desire to attempt something that seemed impossible[^1]. And so, that's how this book came to be dedicated to everyone who has ever had a dream that seemed similarly out of reach (misguided or not). As of now, I'm not sure if my documenting of this process will serve as a cautionary tale for others attempting similar endeavors, but it is my deepest hope that whatever modicum of success this title achieves might encourage others to keep reaching higher.

[^1]: Sure, there are plenty of people who've published books throughout history, but the obstacles still seemed rather daunting when I set out to do this (but that's a discussion for another time).
